* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, you want to first clearly outline what the software should do. Then write automated tests to verify it behaves the way that it should. Use continuous integration to run these checks frequently, and add logging and monitoring to catch issues in production. For security, validate inputs, scan for dependencies, and apply least privilege access controls. Regular reviews, updates, and threat assessments helps the system resist attacks.

* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Start by talking to users and observing how they currently solve the problem to understand their goals and frustrations. Turn your observations into simple user stories such as, “As a student, I want X so that Y.” Build and prototype incrementally, tweaking the system based on feedback.

* How do I approach designing software?

Start by clearly defining the problem, understanding the users' needs, and breaking requirements into smaller, manageable parts. Then, design a modular, scalable system and refine through prototyping and feedback.
